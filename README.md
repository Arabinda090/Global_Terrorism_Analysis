# Global_Terrorism_Analysis
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

In the first Step, we have performed data wrangling over the raw data. the EDA has been analyzed based on 5 objects:
1.	Analysis based on frequency of attack over the years.
2.	Analysis based on weapons.
3.	Analysis based on most active terrorist.
4.	Analysis based on monetary impact.

In analysis based on frequency of attack over the years, we can identify that since 1971 there has been significant increase in terror attacks globally. Terrorist Groups like ISIL, Taliban, Maoistare causing havoc throughout the world by bombing, armed assaults and kidnaping. However, in recent times there has been slight decrease in Terrorist attacks.

In analysis based on weapons,we canclearly see that their way of conducting any attack includes the Bombing/Explosion, followed by armed assault. Every Terrorist attack leaves behind a huge amount of financial loss to the country, which may affect their economy deeply. So, we found out the monetary loss occurred to the world due to terrorism per year.

In analysis based on most active terrorist, we can conclude that most active terrorist organization is Taliban whereas in last 5 years ISIL become the most active terror organization in the world and when we consider India, Maoist become the most active terror organization.

In analysis based on monetary impact, we can identify that between the year 1991 to 1998 the monetary loss was at peak due to terrorism, but particularly in the year 1992 the world witnessed the highest amount of monetary loss due to terror attack which is approximately $25 Billion USD
